# Write any decoded letters and the number they correspond to
# in this file. 
#
# Each decoded letter must be input on a new line. 
#
# These can be letters you are given at the start
# of the puzzle or ones you have worked out 
#
# The format they should be written in is
#  'number' 'equals' 'letter'.
#  e.g. 
# 10 = e
# 19 = q
# etc...
# 
# often no initial letters are required to break the code. 
# 
# Write information below, with no # at the start of the line.
# Letters must be in lower-case.
